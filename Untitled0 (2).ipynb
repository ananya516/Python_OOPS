        "1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- ​Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of \"objects.\" These objects encapsulate both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods), allowing for modular, reusable, and organized code structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) that the objects created from it will have. Each object, or instance, of the class can have unique values for its attributes but shares the same methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a self-contained unit that combines data and behavior. It is an instance of a class, meaning it is created based on the structure defined by that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction is about hiding the complex implementation and showing only the essential features, while encapsulation is about hiding the internal data and protecting it from unauthorized access\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "- They’re also called magic methods because they let you define how your object behaves with built-in functions and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "6 ) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows one class (the child class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (the parent class). This allows for code reuse and helps to create a hierarchy of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a key concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. The word \"polymorphism\" comes from the Greek words poly (meaning many) and morph (meaning form), so it literally means \"many forms.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, encapsulation is achieved through access modifiers. These modifiers control the visibility of attributes and methods in an object. Python doesn't have strict access control like some other languages (e.g., Java or C++), but it provides conventions to simulate encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize newly created objects. It is automatically called when an object of a class is instantiated (created). The constructor is used to set the initial state of the object by initializing the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class method is a method that takes the class itself (cls) as the first argument and can modify class-level attributes or perform operations related to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A static method is a method that doesn't take self or cls as the first argument and doesn't modify class or instance attributes, but can be used for utility functions that logically belong to the class\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different arguments (i.e., a different number or type of parameters) within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, the @property decorator is used to define a method as a getter for an attribute. This allows you to access a method like an attribute, but with the ability to execute additional logic behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, typically through a shared interface or method. The term polymorphism itself means \"many shapes,\" referring to the ability of a single entity to take on different forms.\n",
        "\n",
        "15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. The purpose of an abstract class is to define a common interface for its subclasses, ensuring that the subclasses implement certain methods that are defined as abstract in the abstract class.\n",
        "\n",
        "16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages, including modularity through reusable classes, encapsulation for data protection, inheritance for code reuse, polymorphism for flexible behavior, abstraction for simplifying complex systems, improved maintainability by isolating changes, better collaboration among developers, and greater scalability for adding new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class variable is shared by all instances of a class and is defined within the class, while an instance variable is unique to each instance and is defined inside the __init__ method, making it specific to that instance\n",
        "\n",
        "18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a subclass to combine functionality from multiple classes, enabling more flexibility and code reuse\n",
        "\n",
        "19) Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The __str__ method is used to define a human-readable, user-friendly string representation of an object, typically for printing, while the __repr__ method is used to provide a detailed, unambiguous representation of the object, often for debugging, and ideally should allow the object to be recreated.\n",
        "\n",
        "20) What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent or superclass. It allows you to invoke methods or constructors from the parent class in a way that is dynamic and ensures proper method resolution, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios\n",
        "\n",
        "21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method, used to define behavior when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. It is called when the object's reference count reaches zero, meaning the object is no longer in use and can be safely removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The @staticmethod decorator defines a method that doesn't access the instance or class and is used for utility functions, while the @classmethod decorator defines a method that takes the class (cls) as its first argument and is used to access or modify class-level attributes or create factory methods\n",
        "\n",
        "23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python works with inheritance by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, and it enables method overriding. This means that the same method can behave differently based on the object that is calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python (and in Object-Oriented Programming in general) refers to the technique of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code, where each method returns the object itself (or another object). This allows methods to be called consecutively on the same object, enhancing readability and reducing the need for intermediate variables\n",
        "\n",
        "25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python??\n",
        "\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called like a function. When an instance of a class implements the __call__ method, it makes the object behave like a function, meaning you can invoke the object using parentheses, just as you would a regular function.\n",
